The demand for high-quality baked goods has been increasing due to consumer preference for fresh, soft, and flavorful products, which boosts the adoption of diastatic malt flour. Additionally, the increasing popularity of artisanal bread and other traditional baked items is contributing to market growth, as consumers are seeking premium and more natural ingredients in their food.In the Asia–Pacific region, the adoption of diastatic malt flour is also driven by the trend toward healthier baking products. Consumers are increasingly looking for functional ingredients that not only enhance flavor but also provide nutritional benefits. As such, diastatic malt flour is being used to develop bakery products that are rich in enzymes, which can help with digestion and overall well-being.
