This can be attributed to the increasing demand for easy-to-use, eco-friendly, and quiet lawn care solutions. Homeowners, particularly those with small to medium-sized lawns, prefer cordless mowers because they eliminate the need for gasoline and oil, contributing to a cleaner, more sustainable environment.
